# Intro to AI Group Project
 Created by Hana Segura, Paris Isley, Rudra Jhagroosingh, Sebastian Didone, Lucas Rozenman

 The purpose of this AI is for it to take reviews and scores from IMDb databases and compiles them all together to make a general review on the film, show, webseries, etc. 

 Project setup, dependencies, and how to run the code:
 Simply run all the code on the file, as it should run locally. If anything, just run from the Colab link.
